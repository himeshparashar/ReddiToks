        "So I (22F) live with my roommate Sarah (23F) in a small apartment. She loves to cook these really exotic dishes with strong spices, and honestly, the smell is overwhelming. It fills the entire apartment and sometimes makes me feel nauseous. Yesterday I finally told her that her cooking smells terrible and asked if she could cook less pungent food. She got really upset and said I was being culturally insensitive. AITA?",
